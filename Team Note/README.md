# Python Competitive Programming Team Notes

- This repository is a python library for PS(Problem-Solving) Competition.
- When you need an implementation of a specific algorithm, please let me know.
- 알고리즘 대회를 위한 **파이썬 (Python) 소스코드 저장소**입니다.
- **동빈나** 님의 사이트를 참고해서 만들었습니다. -> [동빈나님 Team Notes](https://github.com/ndb796/Python-Competitive-Programming-Team-Notes/blob/master/README.md)
