```python
N = int(input())
papers = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(N)]
canvas = [[0] * 100 for _ in range(100)]

for paper in papers:
    y, x = paper
    for i in range(x, x+10):
        for j in range(y, y+10):
            canvas[i][j] = 1

answer = 0
for i in range(100):
    for j in range(100):
        if canvas[i][j] == 1:
            answer += 1

print(answer)
